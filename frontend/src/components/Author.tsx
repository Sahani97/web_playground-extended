      <p>
        Evan Wild is an unemployed plumber from Doncaster, who has been really
        "into" wildlife since childhood. He once went to Chester Zoo on holiday
        but got ill after eating a doner kebab.
      </p>
      <p>
        He has never seen a bear, but once read a Daily Mail article about
        them, and thinks they sound cool.
